# Gear information

SFP uses the FAO Gears (https://github.com/openfigis/RefData/tree/gh-pages/gear) as the primary source of data, but in evaluating the different impacts of gears on sustainability, we have had to split some of the existing FAO gears into finer resolution. 

The `gears.csv` file summarises all *gears* and *gear groups* that SFP currently uses. Any given fishery record will be associated with only ONE of these records.
