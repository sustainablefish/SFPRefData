03.11,TBB,Beam trawls,Bottom trawls,"A beam trawl consists of a cone-shaped body ending in a bag or codend, which retains the catch. In these trawls the horizontal opening of the net is provided by a beam, made of wood or metal, which is up to 12 m long. The vertically opening is provided by two hoop-like trawl mostly made from steel. No hydrodynamic forces are needed to keep a beam trawl open. This technique is very successful used in many parts of the world for catching shrimp and flatfish normally in shallower depth than 100 meters. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/305/en"
03.12,OTB,Single boat bottom otter trawls,Bottom trawls,"A bottom otter trawl is a cone-shaped net consisting of a body, normally made from two, four and sometimes more panels, closed by one or two codends and with lateral wings extending forward from the opening. A bottom trawl is kept open horizontally by two otter boards. Bottom trawls usually have an extended top panel (square) to prevent fish from escaping upwards over the top of the net. The mouth of the trawl is framed by an headline with floats to open the trawl vertically and a ground gear, which is designed according to the bottom condition on the fishing ground so as to maximise the capture of targets living close to the bottom and at the same time protect the gear from damage and to facilitate movements across uneven bottom. Bottom otter trawls are operated all over the world in a very wide range of depths (from a few meters to around 1 500-2 000 m), mainly at sea, but also, in some cases in inland waters e.g. lakes. Bottom and demersal species are targeted. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/306/en"
03.13,OTT,Twin bottom otter trawls,Bottom trawls,"A bottom otter trawl is a cone-shaped net consisting of a body, normally made from two, four and sometimes more panels, closed by one or two codends and with lateral wings extending forward from the opening. A bottom trawl is kept open horizontally by two otter boards. In twin otter trawls a boat is rigged to tow two parallel trawls from the stern or from two outriggers. Bottom otter trawls can be operated in a very wide range of depths (from a few meters to around 1 500-2 000 m), mainly at sea, but also, in some cases in inland waters e.g. lakes all over the world. Bottom and demersal species are the targets. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/306/en"
03.14,OTP,Multiple bottom otter trawls,Bottom trawls,"A bottom otter trawl is a cone-shaped net consisting of a body, normally made from two, four and sometimes more panels, closed by one or two codends and with lateral wings extending forward from the opening. A bottom trawl is kept open horizontally by two otter boards. In multiple otter trawls a boat is rigged to tow three or more parallel trawls from the stern or from outriggers. Bottom otter trawls can be operated in a very wide range of depths (from a few meters to around 1 500-2 000 m), mainly at sea, but also, in some cases in inland waters e.g. lakes all over the world. Bottom and demersal species are the targets.http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/306/en"
03.15,PTB,Bottom pair trawls,Bottom trawls,"A bottom pair trawl consists of a cone-shaped body, normally made of two or four (and sometimes more) panels, closed by a codend and with lateral wings extending forward from the opening. Bottom pair trawling is operated by two vessels, each towing a trawl warp attached to the bridles in front of the two trawl wings. One of the vessels is handling the trawl and takes the catch. The other is only a towing vessel. Bottom pair trawls are operated in very shallow waters (2-5 meters) to depths down to 5-800 meters, in marine and inland waters all over the world. They target bottom fish, including flatfish and, to a lesser extent, shrimp."
03.19,TB,,Bottom trawls,"A bottom trawl is constructed like a cone-shaped net that is towed (by one or two boats) on the bottom. It consists of a body ending in a codend, which retains the catch. Normally the net has two lateral wings extending forward from the opening. The mouth of the trawl is framed by headline and groundrope. It is designed and rigged to catch species living on or near the bottom. Bottom contact with the gear is needed for successful operations. Three categories of bottom trawls can be distinguished based on how their horizontal opening is maintained: beam trawls, bottom otter trawls, and bottom pair trawls. Beam trawls are commonly designed without wings. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/205/en"
03.3,TSP,Semipelagic trawls,Bottom trawls,"Semipelagic otter trawl (also called high-aspect semipelagic trawl or semidemersal trawl) fishes close to the seabed, with only the trawl boards, wing end weights and chain droppers coming in contact with the seabed.

SFP-1,TSM,Small mesh bottom trawls,Bottom trawls,"Small mesh trawls are specialized variants of bottom trawls, used to catch e.g. northern shrimp and nephrops lobster around Iceland.http://www.fisheries.is/fisheries/fishing-gear/small-mesh-trawl/"
04.1,DRB,Towed dredges,Dredges,"Gears consisting of a mouth frame to which a holding bag constructed of metal rings or meshes is attached. Boat dredges are principally of two variants: dredges that scrape the surface of the bottom and dredges that penetrate the sea bottom to a depth of 30 cm or more to harvest macro-infauna. Some surface dredges include rakes or teeths to penetrate the top layer of substrate and capture animals recessed into the sea bed. Infaunal dredges can be further separated into those that penetrate the substrate by mechanical force (i.e. long teeth) and those that use water jets to fluidize the sediment (hydraulic dredges, considered under Mechanized dredges). Dredges are employed to catch a variety of bottom dwelling animals, like mussels, oysters, scallops, clams, sea cucumbers, etc. Dredges are operated mainly in coastal areas, but sometimes also in deeper waters on the continental shelf, as well as in inland waters all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/212/en"
04.2,DRH,Hand dredges,Dredges,"Small, light dredges consisting of a mouth frame attached to a holding bag constructed of metal rings or meshes. No boat, or only small undecked vessels are employed. Hand dredges are employed to catch molluscs such as mussels, oysters, scallops, clams, etc. These dredges are operated by hand in shallow waters, from the shore or from a boat, either in inland and sea waters all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/213/en"
04.3,DRM,Mechanized dredges,Dredges,"Hydraulic jet dredges are used to dig and to wash out mussels that have buried themselves in the seabed. Some dredges are so improved that the prey is not only dug out, or stirred up and collected in a bag, but is also conveyed on board the vessel by the same gear. Therefore this gear, combining collecting and hauling, can be considered a harvesting machine. This is especially true in cases where mechanical shellfish diggers are combined with suction pumps, escalators or conveyors. This method is used for harvesting shellfish from the sea bed in inshore and offshore sea waters all around the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/239/en"
04.9,DRX,,Dredges,"Dredges are gears which are dragged along the bottom to catch shellfish. They consist of a mouth frame to which a holding bag constructed of metal rings or meshes is attached. There are two main type of dredges; heavy dredges towed by boats (boat dredges), and lighter ones operated by hand in shallow waters (hand dredges). http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/104/en"
06.1,FCN,Cast nets,Falling gear,"Circular net which is cast from the shore or from a small boat, but, in general, in shallow waters, to catch fish by falling and closing in on them. The cast net has a cone-shape, with weights attached to the perimeter. This kind of nets is used to catch fish swimming near the water surface, in rather shallow waters. Some species of shrimps are also captured with cast nets. Cast nets are employed in both, inland and marine waters, all over the world. Their use is usually restricted to rather shallow waters. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/217/en"
06.2,FCO,Cover pots/Lantern nets,Falling gear,"Cover pots and lantern nets are used to cover fish on the bottom, in shallow waters. The fish which is trapped is taken through an opening in the upper part of the gear. A cover pot is commonly of a wicker construction like a beehive with an opening at the top whereas the lantern net is cover pots made of wooden frames covered by netting. Cover pots are used primarily for capturing fresh water fish, including those that are dug into the mud mainly in inland waters, in very shallow areas (pounds, lakes, floodplains, rivers), in Asia as well as in Africa. This catching method is especially successful in turbid or muddy water, wherein grow many plants as in tropical inland water. This fishing method is mainly used for subsistence fishing activities. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/218/en"
06.9,FG,,Falling gear,These are gears that are clapped down on the prey to be captured. Wooden cover pots and cast nets made of netting are typical gears belonging to this group. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/106/en
99.9,NK,,Gear not known,
07.1,GNS,Set gillnets (anchored),Gillnets and entangling nets,"A set gillnet consists of a single netting wall kept more or less vertical by a floatline and a weighted groundline. The net is set on the bottom, or at a certain distance above it and kept stationary by anchors or weights on both ends. Gillnets are of special interest for artisanal fisheries because it is a low cost fishery. Set gillnets are employed in inland and sea waters all over the world to catch pelagic, demersal and benthic species. The size distribution of the catch is very much dependant on the mesh size used in the gillnet. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en"
07.2,GND,Drift gillnets,Gillnets and entangling nets,"Drift gillnets consist of a string of gillnets kept more or less vertical by floats on the upper line (headrope) and weights on the lower line (groundrope) (sometimes the groundrope is without weights), drifting with the current, in general near the surface or in mid-water. Small solid floats, usually made of plastic or of cork, are attached to the headrope and lead weights are evenly distributed along the groundrope. These nets drift freely with the current connected to the operating vessel. Driftnets are especially used to catch schooling pelagic species like herring, mackerel and sardines, but also for salmon and tuna and pelagic squid are captured with such gears. Driftnets are kept near the surface, or a certain distance below it. They are especially employed in marine waters all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/220/en"
07.3,GNC,Encircling gillnets,Gillnets and entangling nets,"Encircling gillnets are gillnets set vertically, in shallow waters, encircling fish. After the fish has been encircled by the net, noise or other means are used to force them to gill or entangle themselves in the netting. It is a technology commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers. Encircling gillnets are employed in inland and coastal shallow waters all over the world to catch pelagic and demersal very shallow waters species. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/221/en"
07.4,GNF,Fixed gillnets (on stakes),Gillnets and entangling nets,"These gillnets are stretched between two or more stakes driven into the bottom within the inter-tidal area, in coastal waters where there are significant tidal differences. They target coastal species all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/247/en"
07.5,GTR,Trammel nets,Gillnets and entangling nets,"A trammel net consists of two/three layers of netting with a slack small mesh inner netting between two layers of large mesh netting within which fish will entangle. These nets are strings of single, double or triple netting walls kept more or less vertical by floats on the headrope and mostly by weights on the groundrope. These are occasionally set in strings. Small solid floats, usually made of plastic and either cylindrical or egg-shaped, are attached to the head rope and lead weights are evenly distributed along the ground rope. Trammel nets are most common as stationary gear, but they can also be used drifting. These nets are especially used to fish demersal species, fish and crustaceans at, or near to, the bottom in inland and marine waters all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/223/en"
07.6,GTN,Combined gillnets-trammel nets,Gillnets and entangling nets,"This bottom-set gear consists of two parts: an upper one being a standard gillnet where semi-demersal or pelagic fish may be gilled and a lower part being a trammel net where bottom fish may entangle. As standard gillnets or trammel nets the combined nets are maintained more or less vertical by floats on the upper line (headrope) and weights on the ground-line (footrope). These nets may be used to fish above and close to the bottom mainly in marine waters, all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/252/en"
07.9,GEN,,Gillnets and entangling nets,"Gillnets and entangling nets are strings of single, double or triple netting walls, vertical, near by the surface, in midwater on on the bottom, in which fish will gill, entangle or enmesh. Gillnets and entangling nets have floats on the upper line (headrope) and, in general, weights on the ground-line (footrope). Gillnets or entangling nets consist in single or, less commonly, double (both are known as ""gillnets"", strictly speaking) or triple netting (known as ""trammel net"") mounted together on the same frame ropes. Several types of nets may be combined in one gear (for example, combined gillnets-trammel nets). These nets can be used either alone or, as is more usual, in large numbers placed in line ('fleets' of nets). The gear can set, anchored to the bottom or left drifting, free or connected with the vessel. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/107/en"
09.4,LVT,Vertical Lines,Hooks and lines,"A vertical line consists of a line to which is attached sinker and one or several hooks. In commercial fisheries the lines have usually several hooks. The additional hooks can be fixed on the mainline at short intervals with branch lines of a certain length. A special form of vertical lines are the jigger lines, mostly used in the fishery for squid. 
The pelagic, demersal and benthic species are attracted by natural or artificial bait (lures), sometimes in association with light attraction. Vertical lines are operated in a very wide range of depths, either in inland and sea waters. With line fishing it is possible to catch fish on rough ground, even in their hiding places between the rocks, and they are used all over the world."
09.5,LTL,Trolling lines,Hooks and lines,"A trolling line consists of a line with natural or artificial baited hooks and is trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines are often towed at the same time, by using outriggers to keep the lines away from the wake of the vessel. They are employed in marine and in freshwater fishing all over the world to catch small fish (e.g. mackerel) and big pelagic fish as tuna. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/235/en"
09.9,LX,,Hooks and lines,"Hooks and lines are gear where the fish is attracted by a natural or artificial bait (lures) placed on a hook fixed to the end of a line or snood, on which they get caught. Hooks or metallic points (jigs) are also used to catch fish by ripping them when they pass in its range of movement. Hook and line units may be used singly or in large numbers.http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/109/en"
SFP-18,LMH,Mechanized lines,Hooks and lines,"Handlines worked mechanically, using powered reels or drum. They are generally used on medium size vessels, but they may also be used on relatively small boats."
SFP-4,LPH,Pole-lines hand operated,Hooks and lines,Lines used with a pole or rod. For fishing in deep waters the lines are usually operated using reels.
SFP-5,LPM,Pole-lines mechanized,Hooks and lines,"Pole-lines that are mechanized, e.g., for tuna catching, with the pole movement being entirely automatic."
SFP-6,LHH,Handlines hand operated,Hooks and lines,Handlines used without a pole or rod. For fishing in deep waters the lines are usually operated using reels.
SFP-7,LGS,Greenstick gear,Hooks and lines,Green stick fishing rigs consist of one or more 35 to 45 foot long fiberglass poles that are mounted to the stern of the boat deck. The green stick tows a mainline behind the vessel with no more than 10 hooks attached to it. Each hook is connected independently to the mainline so that the fishermen can selectively retrieve them. http://www.seagrantfish.lsu.edu/management/longlines.htm#greensticks
05.1,LNP,Portable lift nets,Lift nets,"Portable lift nets are small lift nets operated by hand, often supported by ringed frames. The net consists in a horizontal netting panel or a bag shaped (which is used with the opening facing upwards). If the hand lift nets are larger, they are dipped into and lifted from the water by means of a long pole. This kind of lift nets are operated from the shore, from bridges in rivers, and on the sea coast from harbour walls. They are set in the water surface or close to the bottom but within a few meters depth to fish pelagic species and crustaceans all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/214/en"
05.2,LNB,Boat-operated lift nets,Lift nets,"Lift nets consist of a horizontal netting panel or a bag shaped like a parallelepiped, pyramid or cone with the opening facing upwards. These gears comprise the bag nets ('basnig') and the blanket nets. Often, depending on target species the catching process is supported by lights (in cases, a series of powerful ones) or simply some bait. Lift nets are hauled out by hand or mechanically. For operating a large lift net and maintain it open, several long poles off one or the two sides of the boat are, in general, necessary. Lift nets are operated from the surface in the upper water column, at sea or in inland waters all over the world, to target small pelagic species. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/215/en"
05.3,LNS,Shore-operated stationary lift nets,Lift nets,"These lift nets, which can be relatively large, are usually operated from stationary installations situated along the shore, where the lifting system are sometimes mechanized. Lift nets consist of a horizontal netting panel framed by wood or metal bars or a bag shaped like a parallelepiped, pyramid or cone with the opening facing upwards. The fish are sometimes attracted by strong lights or bait. Lift nets are operated especially in the water surface either in sea and inland waters to catch pelagic species all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/255/en"
05.9,LN,,Lift nets,"Lift nets are horizontal netting panels or bag shaped like a parallelepiped, pyramid or cone with the opening facing upwards which are submerged at a certain depth, left for a while, the time necessary for light or bait to attract fish over the opening, then lifted out of the water. Three main type of lift nets can be distinguished: portable hand lift nets (used, in general, with light attraction), shore operated stationary lift nets. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/105/en"
09.31,LLS,Bottom-set longlines,Longlines,"Set longlines consists of a mainline and snoods with baited (occasionally unbaited) hooks at regular intervals and are set, in general, on or near the bottom. The number of hooks, distance of snoods on the main line and length of the snoods depends on the target species, the handling capacity and technology used. Longlines set as bottom lines, including on very rough bottom and/or coral reefs, target bottom or demersal species all over the world, from shallow waters to thousand or more meters in depth, on all types of bottoms, including very rough ones. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/232/en"
09.32,LLD,Drifting longlines,Longlines,"A drifting longline consists of a mainline kept near the surface or at a certain depth by means of regularly spaced floats and with relatively long snoods with baited hooks, evenly spaced on the mainline. Drifting longlines may be of considerable length. Some drifting longlines are set vertically, each line hanging from a float at the surface. The method is typical of high seas fisheries but it is also widely used in the national EEZ, sometimes, when the continental shelf is not large, not far from the coast. It is used to target pelagic species as tuna, swordfish and sharks all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/233/en"
09.39,LL,,Longlines,"A longline consists of a mainline and snoods with baited (occasionally unbaited) hooks at regular intervals. The number of hooks, distance of snoods on the main line and length of the snoods depends on the target species, the handling capacity and technology used. Longlines can be set as bottom lines (including on very rough bottom and/or coral reefs) or, less commonly, in midwater or even not far from the surface. Its length can range from few hundred meters in coastal fisheries to more than 50 km in large scale mechanized fisheries.http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/232/en"
SFP-10,LLM,Midwater-set longlines,Longlines,"Longlines set in midwater or even not far from the surface are less common than bottom-set longlines. Set longlines consist of a mainline and snoods with baited (occasionally unbaited) hooks at regular intervals. The number of hooks, distance of snoods on the main line and length of the snoods depends on the target species, the handling capacity and technology used. Midwater or surface set longline target pelagic species all over the world, in the sea and inland. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/232/en"
SFP-11,LBG,Buoy gear,Longlines,"Buoy gear functions like a very small section of surface longline. Each piece of buoy gear has one or two branch lines attached to a mainline, which varies in length according to moon phase. The mainline is then attached to a lighted float or radar-reflecting buoy that allows fisherman to track the gear. Buoy gear was developed to target swordfish following a prohibition on the use of surface longlines in large expanses of the southeast Atlantic. http://www.seagrantfish.lsu.edu/management/longlines.htm#buoygear"
03.21,OTM,Single boat midwater otter trawls,Midwater trawls,"A midwater otter trawl is a cone-shaped net which is towed in mid-water. It consists of a cone-shaped body, normally made of four panels, ending in a codend and the net has lateral wings extending forward from the opening. The horizontal opening is maintained by otter boards. Floats and/or sailkites on the headline and weights on the groundline provide for the vertical opening. Midwater, or pelagic, fishing is carried out mainly at sea, on the continental shelf, sometimes in deeper waters, also in some lakes targeting pelagic species, mainly fish and cephalopods, northern shrimp (also small crustaceans, Antarctic krill) all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/309/en"
03.22,PTM,Midwater pair trawls,Midwater trawls,"A midwater pair trawl has roughly similar design as other midwater trawls but is towed simultaneously by two boats, thus ensuring the horizontal opening of the net. Midwater pair trawls might be designed to have a more rectangular opening than ordinary midwater otter trawls. One of the advantages of pair trawling is the possibility to tow the trawl very close to the surface. Herding effect on fish by the two vessels may increase the capture efficiency in shallow waters and at the surface. Midwater pair trawling is carried out mainly at sea in all depth from coastal to offshore areas, but also in lakes targeting pelagic and demersal species all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/310/en"
03.29,TM,,Midwater trawls,"A midwater otter trawl is a cone-shaped net which is towed in mid-water. It consists of a cone-shaped body, normally made of four panels, ending in a codend and the net has lateral wings extending forward from the opening. The horizontal opening is maintained by otter boards. Floats and/or sailkites on the headline and weights on the groundline provide for the vertical opening. Midwater, or pelagic, fishing is carried out mainly at sea, on the continental shelf, sometimes in deeper waters, also in some lakes targeting pelagic species, mainly fish and cephalopods, northern shrimp (also small crustaceans, Antarctic krill) all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/309/en"
10.1,HAR,Harpoons,Miscellaneous,"These are gears for killing, wounding or grappling fish, whales and marine mammals. In its simplest forms the harpoons are built from a wood pole having a steel point with one or more fixed or movable barbs at its forward end. Usually the harpoon is connected with a retrieving line. Modern harpoons are shot by guns. Harpoons used for whaling can be electrified or equipped with grenades. Harpoons are used in surface marine waters in the Mediterranean sea; off the coast of California, Peru and Chile; North sea (Norwegian waters); and Japanese waters, targeting large pelagic species like tuna and swordfish; sharks; and marine mammals like whales and seals. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/237/en"
10.2,MHI,Hand implements,Miscellaneous,"Long-handled implements, extending the range of the fisher's arm, which can be pushed, thrown or shot for killing, wounding or grappling fish or molluscs. Wrenching gear, clamps, tongs, rakes and spears are types within this group but harpoons are not. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/110/en"
10.3,HMP,Pumps,Miscellaneous,"Pumps as fishing gear can be used only for the harvest of dense concentrations of small species (or cephalopods) not too far from the surface (but occasionally up to almost 100 meters). Mostly the fish is attracted and concentrated by artificial lights. With pumps the prey is taken on board. Because of the limited area of light attraction and effects of suction and performance of the pumps, this technology can be used only for a few species, especially small pelagic fish and cephalopods. The method is not very commonly used. Pump fishing should not be confused with other uses of pumps: (1) On board larger trawlers or purse seiners (for small pelagic fish) to get the catch on board (for emptying the codend of the trawl or the bunt of the seine net). -(2) When dredging with hydraulic dredges. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/238/en"
10.4,MEL,Electric fishing,Miscellaneous,"In addition to stupefying fish by mechanical and chemical means, it is also possible to narcotize them with electricity. Fish otherwise unobtainable are narcotized so that they cannot escape and can thus be easily taken. Electrical fishing is often the only possible method of fishing waters which are otherwise inaccessible because of many obstacles and underwater growths. Used in inland and coastal sea shallow waters all around the world, especially in the northern regions of the world targeting Inland waters fish. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/242/en"
10.5,MPN,Pushnets,Miscellaneous,"Push nets are scoop nets which are pushed, footing in very shallow waters or before a small boat. The net bag is fixed on scissors like cross-sticks to keep the net open. The gear is pushed over the bottom in shallow waters, especially to catch shrimp or shrimp larvae. It may be pushed forward by manpower but the use of boats for pushing the gear is common, too. Push nets are pushed on the bottom in shallow, coastal, waters, along beaches or from a boat, either in inland and sea waters to catch shrimps, shrimp larvae and small fish. These are very common in South East Asia. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/253/en"
10.6,MSP,Scoopnets,Miscellaneous,"These are small hand operated devices formed like bagnets and used to scoop fish and other prey out of the water. Originally they were made of wood like flat baskets but are now more or less deep bags made of netting materials. A typical feature of this gear is that it is held open by a frame around the opening of the bag. The form and operation of the scoop basket/nets, is long known and widely distributed, and differs very much from area to area, like all gear manufactured individually. Scoop nets are mainly used in artisanal fisheries. Scoop nets are operated usually in coastal waters, from the shore or from a boat, either in inland and sea waters all over the world. They are used to target small fish and shrimps. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/254/en"
10.7,MDR,Drive-in nets,Miscellaneous,"Fish can be caught by driving them into a fishing gear of any type. Most of them are caught also without driving, but in small quantities. There are some stationary gear constructions which catch only when the fish are driven into them, among other methods, by swimming or diving fishers or by frightening lines. This gear is used to capture the fish, usually in shallow waters, by driving them into the netting by noise and other means and can be used from the shore or from a boat. They are used in coastal sea and inland waters all around the world to target coastal fish species. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/325/en"
10.8,MDV,Diving,Miscellaneous,"This gear type includes the operation of gathering by hand or with simple hand implements with or without diving equipment. Molluscs, mussels, as well as snails and sea urchins, are the main objects harvested by hand picking in coastal sea and inland waters all around the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/326/en"
10.9,MIS,,Miscellaneous,"As in hunting, man has extended the range of his arm by using long-handled implements, which can be pushed, thrown or shot for killing, wounding or grappling fish or molluscs. Clamps, tongs and raking devices are types within this group but so also are spears, harpoons, arrows and other missiles.http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/110/en"
SFP-13,FW,Fish wheel,Miscellaneous,A fish wheel is a device for catching fish which operates much as a water-powered mill wheel. A wheel complete with baskets and paddles is attached to a floating dock. The wheel rotates due to the current of the stream it is placed into. The baskets on the wheel capture fish traveling upstream. The fish caught in the baskets fall into a holding tank. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_wheel
SFP-14,MPS,Pushed skimmer nets,Miscellaneous,"A net attached on two sides to a triangular frame and suspended from or attached to the sides of a boat, with one corner attached to the side of the boat and one corner resting on the waterbottom.  A ski and one end of the lead line are attached to the corner of the frame that rests on the waterbottom and the other end of the lead line attached to a weight which is suspended from the bow of the boat. Generally used on a moving vessel. The primary difference in fishing butterfly nets and skimmer trawls, is that the former is not fished on the bottom. http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/strategy/la_trawl_gear.pdf"
SFP-2,MPB,Pushed butterfly nets,Miscellaneous,"A fixed, frame-mounted net, used to fish the near-surface waters, which is suspended from the side or sides of a boat, pilings, floats, rafts. Also known as wing nets. The nets are  pushed through the water by the vessel. Butterfly nets may also be static, not pushed, if they are shore installed or the vessel is  anchored in a tidal current to capture emigrating shrimp, in which case they should be categorized under Traps. The primary difference in fishing butterfly nets and skimmer trawls, is that the former is not fished on the bottom. Butterfly nets are pushed so that the top of the frame and net are exposed above the surface of the water. http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/strategy/la_trawl_gear.pdf"
SFP-3,MRG,Miscellaneous - rope grown,Miscellaneous,"This gear type is used in enhanced fisheries which are being included in FS wild, while a decision is pending on whether they fit better under aqua or wild."
02.1,SB,Beach seines,Seine nets,"A beach seine is a seine net operated from the shore. The gear is composed of a bunt (bag or lose netting) and long wings often lengthened with long ropes for towing the seine to the beach. The headrope with floats is on the surface, the footrope is in permanent contact with the bottom and the seine is therefore a barrier which prevent the fish from escaping from the area enclosed by the net. Beach seines are usually set from a boat. Beach seines are generally used near the shore in shallow waters, either inland and sea waters, targeting demersal and pelagic species. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/202/en"
02.2,SV,Boat seines,Seine nets,"Boat seines consists basically of a conical netting body, two relatively long wings and a bag. An important component for the capture efficiency of boat seines is the long ropes extending from the wings, which are used to encircle a large area. Many seine nets are very similar in design to trawl nets. Frequently, however, the wings are longer than on trawls. Seine nets are operated both in inland and in marine waters targeting mainly demersal but to a lesser extent also pelagic species all over the world.http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/203/en"
02.9,SX,,Seine nets,"A seine net is a very long net, with or without a bag in the centre, which set either from the shore or from a boat for surrounding a certain area and is operated with two (long) ropes fixed to its ends (for hauling and herding the fish). Two types of gear can be distinguished in this category: beach seines and boat seines. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/102/en"
SFP-8,SDN,Danish seines,Seine nets,"Danish seine is a form of boat seining also known as ""anchor seine"" where the net is set out from an anchored dhan (marker) buoy and the two drag lines must be, as long as possible, kept into contact with the sea bottom near the opening of the gear to keep the fish together between the two lines and herd them towards the bag of the seine. This fishing technique is particularly applicable where there are areas with flat seabed but no large trawlable bottom; a Danish seine can be operated between several rough spots. Especially used in northern regions; not much in use in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Target species are either scattered on or close to the bottom or aggregated. http://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/1003/en
It differs from Scottish seine where the vessel is sailing while hauling the net, so that a larger area is fished, and selectivity may be different. Scottish seine is an active fishing method whereas Danish is semi-active. http://vbn.aau.dk/files/2877254/App._1-7.pdf"
SFP-9,SSC,Scottish seines,Seine nets,"Scottish seine or ""fly dragging"" is a variation of Danish Seine, where the vessel is sailing while hauling the net, so that a larger area is fished. This method is mainly used in Scottish fishery, but is also used in Denmark, to some extent. This fishing method may be categorized as an active fishing method (FIGIS, 2002) whereas Danish is semi-active. In Scottish seine  the vessel is anchored while hauling the net, and selectivity may be different. http://vbn.aau.dk/files/2877254/App._1-7.pdf 
As for Danish seining, keeping the rope into close contact with the bottom as long as possible during the hauling is a major advantage and, for this reason, special heavy ropes are normally used. Many Seine nets are very similar in design to Trawl nets. Frequently, however, the wings are longer than on trawl nets.This fishing method is especially suitable for the capture of both flatfish and demersal round fish either scattered on or close to the bottom. http://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/1008/en"
01.1,PS,Purse seines,Surrounding nets,"A purse seine is made of a long wall of netting framed with floatline and leadline (usually, of equal or longer length than the former) and having purse rings hanging from the lower edge of the gear, through which runs a purse line made from steel wire or rope which allow the pursing of the net. It is generally considered to be the most efficient gear for catching large and small pelagic species that are shoaling. Target species include aggregated pelagic species (schools) of all sizes from small sardines to the large tunas (skipjack tuna , yellowfin tuna). In general purse seines are surface gears used in the marine coastal and high-sea waters all over the world. Aggregated resources in the upper levels are most common, but fish at depths up to 300 m can be targeted. The purse seines are also used in inland areas when there is enough room for the operation of a large net. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/249/en"
01.2,LA,Surrounding nets without purse lines,Surrounding nets,"Surrounding nets like the lampara net are shaped like a dust pan or a spoon (the leadline is much shorter than the floatline) with two lateral wings and a central bunt with small meshes to retain the catch.  The fish is removed from the net with small seines or by means of a scoop net. Lampara nets are mainly operated in the Mediterranean, in the USA and South Africa especially for sardines, in Argentina for anchoveta and mackerels or in Japan, not only for sardines, but also for seabream and flying fish; sometimes in inland waters. The gear is only be used to target pelgic fish close to the water surface. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/201/en"
01.9,SUX,,Surrounding nets,"Surrounding nets are large netting walls set for surrounding aggregated fish both from the sides and from underneath, thus preventing them from escaping by diving downwards. Apart from a few exceptions, these are surface nets. The netting wall is framed by lines: a floatline on top and leadline at the bottom. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/101/en"
SFP-12,RN,Ring nets,Surrounding nets,"A ring net is a surrounding net the form of which is intermediate hybrid between a purse seine and a lampara net: like on a purse seine, rings at the lower edge of the net, allow using a purse line to close it under the fish (pursing) and like on a lampara net, there is a central bunt (with smaller mesh) in which the capture concentrates as the two wings are hauled together and the leadline being shorter than the floatline give some how a spoon-shape as in lamapara net. The gear is only used to target pelgic fish close to the water surface, in both marine and inland waters all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/250/en"
SFP-15,PSA,Associated purse seining,Surrounding nets,"A purse seine is made of a long wall of netting framed with floatline and leadline (usually, of equal or longer length than the former) and having purse rings hanging from the lower edge of the gear, through which runs a purse line made from steel wire or rope which allow the pursing of the net. Associated or floating object purse seining is a fishing technique where the purse seine is set around either natural floating objects or fish aggregating devices (FADs).http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/249/enhttp://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/40/enhttp://safinacenter.org/2015/12/fishing-gear-101-purse-seines-the-encirclers/"
SFP-16,PSU,FAD-free purse seining,Surrounding nets,"A purse seine is made of a long wall of netting framed with floatline and leadline (usually, of equal or longer length than the former) and having purse rings hanging from the lower edge of the gear, through which runs a purse line made from steel wire or rope which allow the pursing of the net. Unassociated or free-school purse seining is a fishing technique where the purse seine is set around a free-swimming school of fish.http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/249/enhttp://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/40/enhttp://safinacenter.org/2015/12/fishing-gear-101-purse-seines-the-encirclers/"
SFP-17,PSD,Dolphin set purse seining,Surrounding nets,"A purse seine is made of a long wall of netting framed with floatline and leadline (usually, of equal or longer length than the former) and having purse rings hanging from the lower edge of the gear, through which runs a purse line made from steel wire or rope which allow the pursing of the net. Dolphin set purse seining is a fishing technique where the purse seine is set around dolphins and tuna schooling together. The dolphins help the fishers locate the school, and are released from the net during the pursing. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/249/enhttp://www.fao.org/fishery/fishtech/40/enhttp://safinacenter.org/2015/12/fishing-gear-101-purse-seines-the-encirclers/"
08.1,FPN,Stationary uncovered pound nets,Traps,"Stationary uncovered pound nets consist usually of net walls anchored or fixed on stakes, reaching from the bottom to the surface. The nets are open at the surface and include various types of fish herding and retaining devices. They are mostly divided into chambers closed at the bottom by netting. In Japan this group is usually referred to as 'set-nets' (not to be confused with the fixed gillnets). They are set close to the shore line in shallow waters direct in the migration tracks of the fishes. The fish enters voluntarily, but is hampered from coming out. Stationary uncovered pound nets are generally operated in coastal zone sand shallow waters, either in inland, in estuarine and sea waters all over the world. These gears are used especially to catch migrating species, mainly pelagic fish. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/246/en"
08.2,FPO,Pots,Traps,"A pot is designed in the form of cages or baskets, small or large (with dimensions ranging from around half a meter to two), made from various materials (wood, wicker, metal rods, wire netting, plastic etc.). They might have one or more openings or entrances. Most of the pots are set on the bottom, while a few models are designed to be in mid-water. Pots are used with or without bait, depending on the target species. Pots are frequently set in rows. Pots are used to catch crustaceans (lobster, crabs, shrimps), shellfish, octopus, and all kinds of reef fish. Pots are generally operated in a very wide range of depths, either in inland, in estuarine and in marine waters all over the world. While some pots are set on smooth, muddy or sandy bottom for catching shrimp or fish, most of them work best when set close to rocks, reefs, coral or wrecks. Certain models of pot are set in mid-water for pelagic fish. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/225/en
A diversity of designs of pots, such as Norwegian two-chamber pots, are included here.  http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/x2590e/x2590e07.htm"
08.3,FYK,Fyke  nets,Traps,"A fyke net is a fish trap. It consists of cylindrical or cone-shaped netting bags mounted on rings or other rigid structures. It has wings or leaders which guide the fish towards the entrance of the bags. The fyke nets are fixed on the bottom by anchors, ballast or stakes. Fyke nets are generally operated in coastal zone sand shallow waters, either in inland, in estuarine and sea waters. They are usually set in contact to the bottom, in areas with strong currents, targeting coastal species and euryhaline species all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/226/en"
08.4,FSN,Stow nets,Traps,"This is a stationary gear made from netting, usually in the form of a cone or pyramid. Stow nets can be fixed for a long time at the same place in rows. These nets are fixed by means of anchors or stakes, placed according to the direction and strength of the current. The mouths are sometimes held open by a frame, which may or may not be supported by a boat. They are used to target fresh water and marine fishes all over the world. These gears used in rivers, estuaries or shallow coastal waters areas with strong currents. Because of the precondition of strong currents in one direction they are not often used in open marine waters. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/227/en"
08.5,FWR,"Barriers, fences, weirs, etc",Traps,"This is a group of gears made of various materials (stakes, branches, reeds, netting, etc.), and they are usually installed in tidal waters. They generally have a narrow slit leading to an enclosed catching chamber. These gears are generally operated in coastal zones and shallow waters where there are significant tidal differences, in estuaries and also in inland waters. They are usually set from the bottom to the surface, targeting coastal species and euryhaline species all over the world. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/228/en"
08.6,FAR,Aerial traps,Traps,"Jumping fish and gliding fish can be caught on the surface in boxes, rafts, boats and nets (""verandah nets""). Sometimes the fish are frightened to get them to jump out of the water. Aerial traps are generally operated in coastal zones either in inland, in estuarine and sea waters all over the world. They are usually set on the surface and target jumping fish (e.g., mullets) and gliding fish (flying fish). http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/229/en"
08.9,FIX,,Traps,"Traps, large stationary nets or barrages or pots, are gears in which the fish are retained or enter voluntarily and will be hampered from escaping. They are designed in such manner that the entrance itself became a non-return device, allowing the fish to enter the trap but making it impossible to leave the catching chamber. Traps are baited or not. Pieces of fish are often used as bait. Artificial baits are also in use. Other types of traps are provided with large guiding panels made from netting to lead the fish into the catching chamber. Different materials are used for building a trap; wood, split bamboo, netting wire are some examples. http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/108/en"
